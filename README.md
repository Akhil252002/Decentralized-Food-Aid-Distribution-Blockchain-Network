# Decentralized-Food-Aid-Distribution-Blockchain-Network
Decentralized food aid distribution to Ensure transparency, efficiency, and accountability in aid delivery to address inefficiencies and corruption, enabling seamless assistance to those in need.
Features and Functionality
Transparency and Traceability:

Every transaction in the food aid supply chain is recorded on an immutable ledger.
Users can trace the movement of food from producers to recipients.
Fraud Prevention:

Secure and tamper-proof records minimize the risk of diversion and misuse.
Automation through Smart Contracts:

Automates verification processes, such as eligibility checks and distribution triggers.
Cost Efficiency:

Reduces administrative overhead by eliminating intermediaries in the supply chain.
Enhanced Security:

Utilizes cryptographic methods to protect transaction data and ensure confidentiality.
Consumer Empowerment:

End users (aid recipients) can verify the authenticity of food aid using QR codes linked to blockchain data.
Technologies Used
Blockchain Framework: Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric for implementing the decentralized ledger and smart contracts.
Programming Languages:
Solidity (for smart contracts).
JavaScript/Node.js (for front-end and middleware integration).
Database: Decentralized storage systems like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).
Tools:
Truffle Suite for smart contract development and testing.
MetaMask for wallet and blockchain interaction.
Ganache for local blockchain testing.
Integration: QR code generation libraries for consumer interaction.
Deployment Platforms: Cloud services like AWS or Azure for hosting decentralized applications (DApps).
Installation and Usage Instructions
Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm installed on your system.
MetaMask wallet extension installed in your browser.
A blockchain test network (e.g., Ganache or Ethereum Testnet).
Installation:

Clone the project repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/blockchain-food-aid.git
cd blockchain-food-aid
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Compile and deploy smart contracts:
bash
Copy code
truffle compile
truffle migrate
Run the local development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage:

Open the application in a web browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).
Log in using MetaMask to interact with the blockchain.
For Growers: Enter initial data about produce.
For Processors, Suppliers, and Retailers: Log data related to activities in their respective stages.
For Consumers: Scan QR codes on food aid packages to verify their source and supply chain history.
Deployment:

Set up a cloud-based node or connect to an Ethereum Testnet/Mainnet for real-world deployment.
Use IPFS for decentralized file storage and retrieval of data related to food aid distribution.
Testing:

Use tools like Ganache to simulate blockchain transactions.
Write unit tests for smart contracts to ensure functionality and security.
